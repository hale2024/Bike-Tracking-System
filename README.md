# Bike Tracking System

> As a part of CS350 Introduction to Software Engineering Final Project, KAIST (Spring 2022)

The Front end was built based on Next.js and the backend on Node.js. Databases are stored in a free relational database namely PostgreSQL. I used PRISMA ORM to help us manipulate the data in an object-oriented manner which reduces the development cost and effort.
